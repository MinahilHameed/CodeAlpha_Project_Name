# Song Recommendation System

This project implements a Song Recommendation System using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The system is designed to suggest songs based on text data associated with songs. It leverages the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization and cosine similarity to recommend songs.

## Files in the Project

### 1. Song_Recommendation_System.py

This script is responsible for preparing the data and building the recommendation system. The key steps include:

- **Data Loading**: Loading the dataset containing song information.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preprocessing the text data associated with the songs.
  - Convert text to lowercase.
  - Remove unnecessary characters and whitespace.
  - Tokenize and stem the text.
- **Vectorization**: Transforming the preprocessed text into TF-IDF vectors.
- **Similarity Calculation**: Calculating cosine similarity between song vectors to find similar songs.
- **Recommendation Function**: Defining a function that takes a song as input and returns a list of recommended songs.
- **Serialization**: Saving the similarity matrix and preprocessed DataFrame to disk using pickle.

### 2. app.py

This script provides a web interface for the Song Recommendation System using Streamlit. The key features include:

- **Spotify Integration**: Using the Spotipy library to fetch album cover images from Spotify.
- **UI Components**:
  - A header for the application.
  - A dropdown menu for selecting a song.
  - A button to generate recommendations.
  - Displaying recommended songs along with their album covers.
- **Recommendation Function**: Loading the precomputed similarity matrix and DataFrame, and using the recommendation function to display results.

## How to Run

1. **Setup Environment**:
   - Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas nltk sklearn spotipy streamlit
     ```
   - You need to have your Spotify API credentials (CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET).

2. **Prepare Data**:
   - Run `Song_Recommendation_System.py` to preprocess the data and save the similarity matrix and DataFrame.

3. **Run the Web Application**:
   - Start the Streamlit app by running:
     ```bash
     streamlit run app.py
     ```

## Example Usage

Once the web application is running, you can select a song from the dropdown menu and click on "Show Recommendation" to get a list of similar songs along with their album covers fetched from Spotify.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- nltk
- sklearn
- spotipy
- streamlit

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to build a simple yet effective song recommendation system using NLP techniques and provides a user-friendly web interface for generating and displaying song recommendations.
